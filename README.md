# SanFrancisco-Happy-Meter

This project visualizes a cluster analysis on parks, schools, and water infrastructures in San Francisco. I analyze three datasets and extract latitude/longitude coordinates which is then run through a density-based spatial clustering node (DBSCAN). This creates cluster data which is then exported into Google Earth Pro for visualization.

Contains:
UTM conversion program for latitude and longitude coordinates.
All datasets used: raw, processed, converted

required libraries
-pip install pandas pyproj
Python 3.6-3.11

Google Earth Pro (Software) required for visualization
